This project focuses on classifying images into five distinct categories using machine learning. It utilizes two models, `model_1.h5` and `model_2.h5`.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the models can be found at [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepghs/image_classification).

## Project Status

This project is currently discontinued. However, it is complete and functional with an accuracy of approximately 85%.

## Models

There are two models used in this project:

1. `model_1.h5`: This model takes an image of dimensions 500x500 as input.
2. `model_2.h5`: This model takes an image of dimensions 400x400 as input.

## Model Output
{`drawings`: 0, `hentai`: 1, `neutral`: 2, `porn`: 3, `sexy`: 4}

## Usage

To use these models, input an image of the specified dimensions into the corresponding model. The model will then output the category to which the image is most likely to belong.
